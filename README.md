## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions for labs and programming assignments on Coursera courses. Certain resources required by the codes may be lacking due to limitations on downloading course materials from Coursera and uploading them to GitHub. The lacking resources are mostly datasets, pre-trained models or certain weight matrices.
